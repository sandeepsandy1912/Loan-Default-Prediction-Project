# Loan-Default-Prediction-Project
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting loan defaults using data from a peer-to-peer lending platform. The project involves implementing and comparing various models, including linear regression, ridge regression, LASSO, random forest, and neural networks, to identify the best approach for predicting loan defaults.

Project Objectives

1. Data Preparation: Create a binary outcome variable y to indicate loan default status.
                     Transform and preprocess predictors, including categorical and continuous variables.

2. Modeling: Implement multiple regression and machine learning models.
             Optimize hyperparameters and evaluate model performance.

3. Evaluation: Compare models based on performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Accuracy).
               Identify the best model for predicting loan defaults.

4. Feature Analysis: Analyze correlations between predictors and loan default status.
                     Identify the most and least important variables.


Key Findings

1. Best Model: The best-performing model is identified based on evaluation metrics.

2. Feature Importance: Key predictors for loan default are highlighted.
                       The most and least correlated variables with loan default status are analyzed.

3. Model Insights: Linear regression provided baseline performance.
                   Regularization methods (Ridge and LASSO) improved generalization.
                   Random Forest captured complex patterns, with high variable importance insights.
                   Neural networks delivered robust classification accuracy.
